Creating the pool using a context manager is a good practice to let Python terminate child processes and their associated resources gracefully. The poolâ€™s .map() method works similarly to the built-in map() function, becoming its parallel equivalent. It takes a callable as the first argument, followed by an iterable of input values for that callable.
