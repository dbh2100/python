# Quaternion Folder

A quaternion is a number in a four-dimensional mathematical system.  It can be described as the sum of a scalar and a three-dimensional vector.

This folder contains a highly developed quaternion class, a quaternionic integer and numpy-inspired subclasses, and several tools for use with quaternions.
