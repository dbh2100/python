# Quaternions

A quaternion is a number in a four-dimensional mathematical system.  It can be described as the sum of a scalar and a three-dimensional vector.

This folder contains a [highly developed quaternion class](https://github.com/dbh2100/python/blob/main/quaternion/quaternion.py), a [quaternionic integer](https://github.com/dbh2100/python/blob/main/quaternion/quaternionic_integer.py) and [numpy-inspired subclasses](https://github.com/dbh2100/python/blob/main/quaternion/quaternion_numpy.py), and [several tools for use with quaternions](https://github.com/dbh2100/python/tree/main/quaternion/utils).
