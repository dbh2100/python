# Python Projects Collection

A curated collection of small Python projects and reference implementations covering algorithms, data structures, numerical utilities, and simple games. These projects are intended for learning, experimentation, and demonstration.

## Highlights
- [large_numbers](large_numbers): utilities for very large and transfinite numbers (aleph numbers, hyperoperations).
- [games](games): implementations of several classic games (2048, Connect4, Othello, Rubik's Cube).
- [data_structures](data_structures): implementations and utilities for graphs, trees, heaps, and immutable mappings.
- [sorting_algos.py](sorting_algos.py): a set of sorting algorithm implementations and helpers.
- [blockchain.py](blockchain.py): a minimal illustrative blockchain implementation.
- [number_to_words.py](number_to_words.py): number-to-words conversion utilities.
- [prime_gen.py](prime_gen.py): simple prime number generator examples.
- [running_median.py](running_median.py): streaming running-median implementation.

## Getting Started
Install the project dependencies (if needed):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the test suite from the repository root:

```bash
pytest
```
