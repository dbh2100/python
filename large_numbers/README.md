## Large Numbers

This folder contains a module defining an aleph number class and one defining hyperoperations.

### Aleph Numbers

#### &#8501;&#8320;, &#8501;&#8321;, &#8501;&#8322;,...

An aleph (&#8501;) number is a type of infinite number.

&#8501;&#8320; ("aleph naught") is the cardinality of the set of positive integers.

&#8501;<sub>n+1</sub> is the number of combinations of &#8501;<sub>n</sub> items.

### Hyperoperations

#### 3 &#8593 &#8593 4

A hyperoperation is a higher order of arithmetic operation beyond exponentiaion.  For example the tetration of a number, denoted by x &#8593;&#8593 y, <super>y</super>x, or H<sub>4(x, y), is x to the power of x y times.  So <super>3</super>2 = 2<super>2<super>2</super></super> = 16.  These numbers can become extremely large.  For example, <super>3</super>3 = 3<super>3<super>3</super></super> = 7,625,597,484,987.
