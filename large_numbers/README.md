## Large Numbers

This folder contains a module defining an aleph number class and one defining hyperoperation functions.

### Aleph Numbers

#### &#8501;&#8320;, &#8501;&#8321;, &#8501;&#8322;,...

An aleph (&#8501;) number is a type of infinite number.

&#8501;&#8320; ("aleph naught") is the cardinality of the set of positive integers.

&#8501;<sub>n+1</sub> is the number of combinations of &#8501;<sub>n</sub> items.

### Hyperoperations

#### 3 &#8593;&#8593; 4

A hyperoperation is a higher order of arithmetic operation beyond exponentiaion.  For example, the tetration of a number, denoted by x &#8593;&#8593; y, <sup>y</sup>x, or H<sub>4</sub>(x, y), is x to the power of x y times.  So <sup>3</sup>2 = 2<sup>2<sup>2</sup></sup> = 16.

These numbers can become extremely large.  <sup>3</sup>3 = 3<sup>3<sup>3</sup></sup> = 7,625,597,484,987.
